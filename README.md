# Netflix-Data-Analysis using SQL
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of Netflixâ€™s movies and TV shows dataset using SQL. The primary goal is to extract valuable insights by answering business-relevant questions related to content distribution, ratings, release years, countries, durations, and specific categorization.

# Objectives:
1. Analyze the distribution of Netflix content into movies and TV shows to identify trends
2. Analyze Netflix content based on release years, countries, and durations to explore content popularity and trend over time
3. Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows to uncover patterns and viewer preferences.

# Table Creation
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

# Business Problems and Solutions:
## 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```
(To Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix)
## 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
(To identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.)
